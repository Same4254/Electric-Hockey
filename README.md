# Electric-Hockey

### Protons Electrons and  Neutrons ###
  This is a game based on the repulsion of sub atomic particles. This force acts as a way to drive one particle around obstacles and into a goal. Much like the phet program Electric Hockey. However I wanted to take it a step forward.
  
### Difficulty ###
  When playing the Phet activity, I found the 3 levels to be too short. I plan to make a side program to design levels. Also, I didn't find them to be particularly difficult, this is especially true when you realize that you can just go around everything, or just drag a particle next to the "puck". What I want to add is moving obstacles and more complex levels. 
  
  One other major thing that I really wanted to see was having ALL of the particles move, as I saw many people just chuck in particles willy-nilly all over the place.
